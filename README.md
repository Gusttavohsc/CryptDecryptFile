## How to use

- Choose any kind of file that you want to encrypt
- Choose a key to encrypt and decrypt later
- Each file have it's own decryption key, so if you lost it, you lost the file
- A file copy will be created at "originalFiles/ext", where 'ext' represents the original file extension
- The encrypted file will be created at "encryptedFiles" with '.enc' extension
- To decrypt, select the encrypted file and write the right decryption key
- The decrypted file will be created at "decryptFiles" without '.enc' extension
- If you write a wrong decryption key, the decrypter will work without error, but your files will be useless
